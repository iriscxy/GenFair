there is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis . the left lung is clear . there is no pneumothorax . the heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection .
frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained . there is a large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis underlying consolidation is not excluded . the left lung is clear . the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable .
lung volumes are low . heart size is mildly enlarged . mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable . crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema . patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis . no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present . there are no acute osseous abnormalities .
ap upright and lateral views of the chest provided . lung volumes are low limiting assessment . allowing for this there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema . no large effusion or pneumothorax . cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable . bony structures are intact .
