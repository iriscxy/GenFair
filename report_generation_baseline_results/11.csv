moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated . the aorta is diffusely calcified . mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged . pulmonary vasculature is not engorged . patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis . no focal consolidation pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present . there are no acute osseous abnormalities .
lung volumes are low . heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a moderate to large left pleural effusion . the mediastinal contour is unremarkable . there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion . patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis . no pneumothorax is identified . there are no acute osseous abnormalities .
